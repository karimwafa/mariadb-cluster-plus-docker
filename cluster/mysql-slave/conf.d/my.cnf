server-id = 2 # This will need to be unique per slave, but for simple volume mounting we might need a workaround or separate dirs. 
# actually, mariadb allows overriding server-id via command line or we can just make separate confs.
# For simplicity with shared config volume, we can rely on environment variable or just accept they might share config but we can override in container definition? 
# No, config file wins usually.
# Let's use a trick or just simple separate folders if needed.
# For now, let's keep it simple. If we map the same config, they have same server-id which is bad.
# Fix: I'll create separate config lines or use a launch script. 
# Better: Just don't set server-id in the file for slaves, pass it via command: --server-id=X in docker-compose.
